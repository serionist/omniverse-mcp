name: write-skill
description: >-
  Use when someone asks for a new skill, a slash command or a reusable agent recipe in this repo, a skill of the
  Claude Code plugin (plugin/skills), or to fix a skill that is wrong or out of date. Keeps every repo skill usable
  by Claude Code and Codex alike, links it into .agents/skills and lists it in AGENTS.md; keeps a plugin skill to
  read-only tools in allowed-tools and lists it in plugin/README.md.

# Write a skill

Skills here serve Claude Code and Codex alike. A skill is a recipe an agent follows: steps in a fixed order, a
definition of done, hard nevers, and the traps already paid for. Deterministic work belongs in a script the skill
calls, not in prose the agent has to get right.

## Steps

1. **Check it is needed.** Search `.claude/skills/` for a skill that already covers the request; change that one
   rather than adding a near-duplicate.
2. **Create the folder** `.claude/skills/<name>/` with `SKILL.md`. The folder name equals `name`: lowercase letters,
   digits and hyphens, at most 64 characters.
3. **Frontmatter** holds `name` and `description`, and nothing else. The description puts the trigger first
   ("Use when ..."), names the requests that should fire it, and stays within 1,024 characters. Write it as a `>-`
   block, as every skill here does: a `: ` or ` #` in a plain value is invalid YAML for the tools that parse it
   strictly.
4. **Body,** at most about 200 lines, in the house shape (`start-work` is the model):
   - what the skill is for, in two or three sentences;
   - **Steps:** numbered, each naming the file, tool or command it touches. A scope (a diff, a review, a branch) is
     named as the git command that resolves it, never in words;
   - **Done means:** what must be true when the agent stops;
   - **Never:** the hard rules;
   - **Traps,** once there are some: what broke, when, the guard.
   A file the skill reads beside `SKILL.md` (such as `lenses.md`) sits in its folder and is named in the step that
   uses it.
5. **Scripts** a skill needs live in `tools/`, standard library only, with tests in `tests/`, and are named by their
   path from the repo root (`uv run tools/<name>.py`). If the work is deterministic, write the script first.
6. **Link it for Codex:** `uv run tools/setup.py link <name>`. It writes `.agents/skills/<name>` into git's index as
   a symlink to the skill, so the commit has the link on any machine, a Windows clone without Developer Mode
   included. Commit the link with the skill.
7. **List it** in `AGENTS.md`, in the skills line under How a change lands: its name and when to use it.
8. **Run `uv run tools/gate.py quick`.** It checks the frontmatter (only `name` and `description`, the name equal to
   the folder, the description set, "Use when ..." first, within 1,024 characters), that `AGENTS.md` names the skill,
   and that each skill has its link and each link leads to a skill. The rest is review.

## Plugin skills

`plugin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` serves the plugin's users, in Claude Code, not this repo's developers. Steps 1 to 4
hold, with these differences:

- **`allowed-tools`** may join `name` and `description`, as a `>-` block naming only tools whose `readOnlyHint` is
  true in `tests/fixtures/mcp-tools.json`, as `mcp__plugin_omniverse-mcp_omniverse__<tool>`: a tool that edits the
  stage, saves or exports a file, or runs code always asks the user. Never `execute_script`, never a shell command.
- **Links** are full GitHub URLs: Claude Code installs `plugin/` without the rest of the repo.
- **A version** is written as the plugin pins it, `omniverse-mcp==<version>`; the gate holds every pin under
  `plugin/` equal to `pyproject.toml`'s, and a release bumps them together.
- **No link and no AGENTS.md line:** list it as `/omniverse-mcp:<name>` in `plugin/README.md`'s table instead, and in
  `docs/AI_GUIDE.md`'s, which other clients read.

Gate quick checks each of these: the frontmatter and `allowed-tools`, every link, every version, both listings, and
that `plugin/` holds no file it doesn't check (a command, an agent, a hook would each run something). Then it runs
`claude plugin validate --strict` on the plugin and the marketplace when Claude Code is installed; that reads no
skill's frontmatter.

## Done means

- The skill fires on the requests in its description and on nothing unrelated.
- Every path, tool and command it names exists.
- A repo skill: `.agents/skills/<name>` links to it and `AGENTS.md` names it. A plugin skill: `plugin/README.md`
  and `docs/AI_GUIDE.md` list it.
- Gate quick passes.

## Never

- Claude-only syntax in a repo skill: `!` shell injection, `$ARGUMENTS`, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`,
  `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`, or `allowed-tools`. A plugin skill takes `allowed-tools` for read-only tools only.
- A skill that restates a rule instead of pointing at it: name the section of `AGENTS.md` or `REVIEW.md`.
- A rule kept only in a skill's prose when a check could keep it: add the check to `tools/gate.py`, with its test.
- `ln -s` from Git Bash, or a copied folder, for the link: use `setup.py link`.

## Traps

| What broke | When | The guard |
|---|---|---|
| A skill's folder name differed from its `name`, and the tool dropped the skill without a word | another repo, 2026-10 | gate quick compares them |
| Git Bash's `ln -s` copied the folder instead of linking it, and Codex read a stale copy | another repo, 2026-10 | `setup.py link`; gate quick reads each link's mode from git's index |
| A description with `: ` in it read fine in Claude Code and was invalid YAML in Codex | another repo, 2026-10 | Every description is a `>-` block; gate quick refuses a plain one with `: ` |
